                <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
                <p> Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest, and decreased motivation. It affects mood, thoughts, and daily functioning, and can be triggered by genetics, environment, or life events.</p>

                <p>There are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Major depression includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of the time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities.</li>
                    <li>Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder) consists of less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years.</li>
                    <li>Perinatal depression is depression that occurs during pregnancy or after childbirth. Depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression, and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression.</li>
                    <li>Seasonal affective disorder is depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall or early winter and going away during the spring and summer.</li>
                    <li>Depression with symptoms of psychosis is a severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see).</li>
