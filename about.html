                    <h3>Blues Cues History</h3>
                    <p>Blues Cues was born from a personal journey of resilience and hope. Our founder, Danny Gomez, navigated the challenges of depression and anxiety, searching for supportive resources and connections. Despite feeling lost and isolated, Danny Gomez discovered solace in creative expression, community, and compassionate guidance.

                        The Spark
                        
                        During a transformative moment, Danny Gomez realized that even in darkness, there were cues â€“ subtle signs of hope and resilience. These cues inspired a sense of purpose: to create a safe space where others could find support, guidance, and community.
                        
                        The Vision Takes Shape
