                    <p>Now, if you seek to learn these instruments but you can only afford to learn one, You can watch the following video that may help you make a decision.</p>
                    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBTSNZLdJcM?si=r4-UdZ6Lhm6N_dEx" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p>After making your decision, you may feel this rush of energy going through your body, with a whole new world of endless possible things you could play, yet your mind goes blank at the same time, and you're stuck without knowing what to play. Well personally I would recommend choosing one album in particular and learning the songs that already have a piano instrumentation or you could play songs from games OST.</p>

                        *P.S. If you're interested in knowing my opinion of  the relation between games and music then you should definitely check out my next page that talks more about it.</p>
